Most of the challenges faced were related to setup of MicroBlaze through the EDK. However, lots of challenges were overcome to understand how Xgpio worked, including understanding the xparameters.h header file.

When first attempting to create the multiplier application, the team consistently had issues setting up a serial connection. After several attempts to remap the soft processor in an attempt to fix an error in the setup, we came to the realization that our understanding of how serial communication works on the FPGA was flawed. We expected the I/O to travel through the programming cable instead of separately using the serial port and cable. Furthermore, once serial communication was set up, we realized each input sent a null byte after it as well, and therefore any read commands would not receive the whole input string. This was solved by continuously fetching a new string after any possible null byte.

The hardest challenge of this project was in the setup of the rock paper scissors application. The first major challenge was understanding how to interface with the diligent keypad, which was expected to be a simple task of reading binary values into the MicroBlaze c program. The team once again misunderstood the fundamentals of the task at hand. To resolve this issue we learned how to use the EDK to add GPIO specification pins. Once this was done we once again rebuilt the processor, however we still didn't fully understand how the keypad worked. Upon further inspection we had to make the GPIO pins not output only but rather to support input and output and to raise each pin to high in order to get readings from the output pins. This issue was solved by finding a circuit diagram of the pmod keypad and understanding the complexities of the system.

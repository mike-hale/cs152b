Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   126 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 126
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        308 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                      305 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             270
      Number using O5 output only:              32
      Number using O5 and O6:                    3
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         3
  Number of route-thrus:                        35
    Number using O6 output only:                35

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   130 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          313
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           187 out of     313   59%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   5 out of     313    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         121 out of     313   38%
    Number of unique control sets:              22
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              50 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        11 out of     480    2%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       11 out of      11  100%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.51

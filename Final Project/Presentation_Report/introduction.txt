This final project for CS152B was an open ended exploration of an application of FPGAs. It involved designing and building the product using the knowledge obtained over the quarter. Our goal for this project was to familiarize ourselves with the complexities of building a large multiple function system in verilog and learn more about the possibilities of programmable hardware.

Our project was an integer identifier using convolutional neural networks trained on the popular MNIST dataset for handwritten digits. The FPGA would train on the data set and store the optimal set of weights. The data set would be sent over serial from a personal computer. After training is completed, on the PC, the user can draw an image and send it over serial to be tested on the trained weights. This will then print out the correct response to a seven segment display. All controls are done without input on the FPGA, but by  feeding in different sets of data from the PC, either training data or our test image data.
